A repository for our RISC-V lab. 

	Guidelines:
	1- Please make a separate branch whenever you are to resolve an issue (e.g issue-x)
	2- When you have thoroughly resolved an issue, only generate a merge request.
 	3- Please rebase your issue branch with main regularly.(I might need to commit to main).
	3- NO ONE WILL PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH.
