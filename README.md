A repository for our RISC-V lab. 

	Guidelines:
	1- Please make a separate branch whenever you are to resolve an issue (e.g issue-x)
	2- When you have thoroughly resolved an issue, only generate a merge request.
	3- Please rebase your issue branch with the main one regularly. (So there may be no issues merging later on.)
	3- NO ONE WILL PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH.
